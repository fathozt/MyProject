Its been a very long time since I am not touching this project. 

It is build with .Net Core. Just basic CRUD operations. Has a control panel that you need a password to login and you can add, delete, update and list products.

I used Repository desing pattern for this project to write less code and to bring a standart.

Used code first approach to create database with MSSQL.
